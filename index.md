Hi there! 

I'm Arne, an enthusiast of using Data-Driven Computational Methods to practically improve the health of people - think Visualization, Machine Learning and Computational Statistics. I'm deeply fascinated by learning in all its different forms. From Nutrition, the body and Cognitive Psychology to learning Jiu Jitsu and how cultural differences guide our lives.

Science and Engineering often pose questions that can only be addressed with complex data. Distilling and communciating meaning out of that data to improve people's lives yield amazing puzzles. I'll use this website to showcase some examples of how that can be done.

### My background

I started out with a BSc and MSc in Mathematics. I wanted to use the tools learnt there for Science and Engineering, and took this further in a Doctoral Training Program in Statistics at the Universities of Warwick and Oxford.

I've often been at the cross-section of different fields. During my Mathematics studies, I looked at the interplay between different subfields of Mathematics and Physics. Doing Statistics research, I was engaged with Personalised Medicine and Cognitive Psychology. It is a position I cherish, as it allows to make new connections that drive those fields.

I took a break from Machine Learning to explore more directly for others. It led me to look into [sustainable volunteering](http://blog.grassrootsvolunteering.org/independent-volunteer/). I worked as a [volunteer trek guide](https://www.quetzaltrekkers.com/xela/) in Guatemala for 4 months and travelled to get in touch with people of different backgrounds. 

As self-study projects, I've had a look at Neuroeconomics literature, metabolic health literature and Reinforcement Learning methodology.

Aside of that, I love my gym routine, Jiu Jitsu, Climbing, cycling, reading and working with other people.

### View on Data Science

Often there's a high focus on Modelling Methods - your favourite Neural Network, Tree methods, ... While these are very useful tools, the whole Data Science process has some important steps that underemphasized in my opinion. 

- Exploratory analyses to understand the data
- The importance of finding appropriate outcomes and metrics to solve your question. 
- Do you want interventional insight? This requires investigating the structure behind your data more deeply. 
- Developing diagnostics and validation methods to `really` understand what the conclusions of your analyses and models are

These tend to be more vague and chaotic. Moreover, they often depend heavily on the problem and solution method at hand. These are primary as they define the question and conclusions. Then a series of complex approximators can be considered if necessary, in an iterative process where the above can be adapted as you start to understand the data better.

I hope to illustrate these in the examples on this website.
